# Rock-Paper-Scissors Detection Program

This program is designed to detect and identify the gestures of Rock, Paper, and Scissors using advanced algorithms. It leverages [specify the method, e.g., image recognition, sensor input, etc.] to accurately classify each gesture.

## Features

- **Gesture Detection**: Recognizes three distinct gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides immediate feedback on the detected gesture.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to enhance detection accuracy.

## How It Works

1. **Input Capture**: The program captures input from a [specify input device, e.g., camera, sensor, etc.].
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Analyzes the input using [specify method, e.g., image processing, neural networks, etc.] to identify the gesture.
3. **Output Display**: Displays the detected gesture on the screen with additional information if applicable.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-detection.git
    cd rock-paper-scissors-detection
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Ensure you have installed.
    - Install required Python packages:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. **Run the Program**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the program by running the `implementasi.py` script.
2. The program will capture input from the specified device.
3. Make a gesture (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) in front of the input device.
4. The detected gesture will be displayed on the screen.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: [specify language, e.g., Python]
- **Detection Algorithm**: [specify algorithm, e.g., convolutional neural networks, edge detection]
- **Input Device**: Compatible with [specify devices, e.g., webcams]
